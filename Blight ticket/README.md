# Random forest model
this project is built and optimized using SKLEARN.
Blight tickets are issued by the city of Detroit to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition.
This model's purpose is to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time.
# Data
- data/train.csv - the training set (all tickets issued 2004-2011)
- data/test.csv - the test set (all tickets issued 2012-2016)
- data/addresses.csv & data/latlons.csv - mapping from ticket id to addresses, and from addresses to lat/lon coordinates.
